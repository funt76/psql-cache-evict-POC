It has been started as a proof of concept for JPA auto cache eviction mechanism based on Postgres notifications which i'm gonna
make in the nearest future; hence the name of the project.

StackOverflow so made my own answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/26126168/1535995 (up vote it if you like it), though still cannot
understand their contributor's motivation policy when the absolutely trivial question or answer gets hundreds of upvotes while
elaborate answer taking time and effort to investigate and write gets zero... no I completely understand why is it so,
just very different target audience size, i just cannot understand why they do nothing to change it, that way they gonna end up bad....
enough on SO, though....
or start of Spring boot which i like since i tried it
